________________________________________
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A seasoned Embedded Systems Engineer with a deep-rooted passion for electronics, spanning over 15 years of technical evolution. From mastering low-level AVR ATmega architectures in 2010 to developing sophisticated ESP32-based IoT solutions today. My work focuses on creating "production-ready" systems that prioritize long-term stability, efficient memory management, and seamless web integration.

FLAGSHIP PROJECT: Smart Egg Incubator System
An enterprise-grade incubation solution designed for continuous industrial use.
Key Achievements:
•	15-Month Field Test: Proven stability with over a year of continuous operation in real-world environments without system crashes or memory leaks.
•	Dual-Core Architecture: Optimized task management by running networking on Core 0 and incubation logic on Core 1 for maximum responsiveness.
•	Custom Memory Map: Utilized a Huge APP partition (3MB) to host a robust local web server and data logging system via LittleFS.
•	Real-Time Diagnostics: Built-in hardware health monitoring (Free Heap, Chip ID, RTC Sync).
Tech Stack (v2.3.2):
•	Languages: C/C++, JSON, Arduino.
•	Web Integration: ESPAsyncWebServer, AsyncTCP.
•	Time Management: DS3231 RTC for precision scheduling.
•	UI/UX: Integrated LED Matrix (MD_Parola) and interactive Web Dashboard.
